/**
 * Specify this setting only when your output will be consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that is sensitive to
 * very small duration differences between video and audio. For this situation, choose Match video duration
 * (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
 * When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them to ensure
 * that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After
 * padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert
 * applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs,
 * MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any minor discrepancies
 * between audio and video duration will depend on your output audio codec.
