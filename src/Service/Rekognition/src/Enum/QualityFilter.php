/**
 * A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't
 * indexed. If you specify `AUTO`, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or
 * `HIGH`, filtering removes all faces that donâ€™t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is `AUTO`. The
 * quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some
 * examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too
 * extreme to use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed.
 * To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.
