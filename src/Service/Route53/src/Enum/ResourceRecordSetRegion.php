/**
 * *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the resource that this resource
 * record set refers to. The resource typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB
 * load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.
 *
 * > Although creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not
 * > supported.
 *
 * When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have created latency resource
 * record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the end user and
 * the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource
 * record set.
 * Note the following:
 *
 * - You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per latency resource record set.
 * - You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.
 * - You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the
 *   region with the best latency from among the regions that you create latency resource record sets for.
 * - You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as
 *   latency resource record sets.
