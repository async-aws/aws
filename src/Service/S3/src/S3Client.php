     * This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded
     * using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part
     * uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary
     * to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.
     *
     * To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the part storage, you should call the
     * ListParts [^1] API operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.
     *
     * > **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.

     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^4] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^5].

     * Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.
     *
     * You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart [^1] operation or the
     * UploadPartCopy [^2] operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this
     * `CompleteMultipartUpload` operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all
     * the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must
     * provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation
     * concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the `PartNumber`
     * value and the `ETag` value that are returned after that part was uploaded.
     *
     * The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins
     * processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a `200 OK` response. While processing is in
     * progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could
     * fail after the initial `200 OK` response has been sent. This means that a `200 OK` response can contain either a
     * success or an error. The error response might be embedded in the `200 OK` response. If you call this API operation
     * directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If
     * you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error
     * handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the
     * condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).
     *
     * Note that if `CompleteMultipartUpload` fails, applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including
     * 500 error responses). For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices [^3].
     *
     * ! You can't use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for the CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if
     * ! you don't provide a `Content-Type` header, `CompleteMultipartUpload` can still return a `200 OK` response.

     *
     * - `Authentication and authorization`:
     *
     *   All `CopyObject` requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret
     *   access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be
     *   signed. For more information, see REST Authentication [^5].
     *
     *   **Directory buckets** - You must use the IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the
     *   `CopyObject` API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API
     *   operation.
     *
     *   Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   You must have *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the destination bucket.
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in an IAM policy based on the source and
     *     destination bucket types in a `CopyObject` operation.
     *
     *     - If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have **`s3:GetObject`** permission to read the
     *       source object that is being copied.
     *     - If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have **`s3:PutObject`** permission to write the
     *       object copy to the destination bucket.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy
     *     based on the source and destination bucket types in a `CopyObject` operation.
     *
     *     - If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the
     *       **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default,
     *       the session is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the
     *       `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the copy source bucket.
     *     - If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in
     *       the `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The `s3express:SessionMode` condition
     *       key can't be set to `ReadOnly` on the copy destination bucket.
     *
     *     For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone [^6] and Amazon Web Services Identity
     *     and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone [^7] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Response and special errors`:
     *
     *   When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When the request is not an HTTP 1.1
     *   request, the response would not contain the `Content-Length`. You always need to read the entire response body to
     *   check if the copy succeeds. to keep the connection alive while we copy the data.
     *
     *   - If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.
     *   - A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the
     *     files. A `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error.
     *
     *     - If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error.
     *     - If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the `200 OK` response. For
     *       example, in a cross-region copy, you may encounter throttling and receive a `200 OK` response. For more
     *       information, see Resolve the Error 200 response when copying objects to Amazon S3 [^8]. The `200 OK` status
     *       code means the copy was accepted, but it doesn't mean the copy is complete. Another example is when you
     *       disconnect from Amazon S3 before the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you may receive a
     *       `200 OK` response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the entire response is successfully received and
     *       processed.
     *
     *       If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the content of the
     *       response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs
     *       detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically
     *       retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs
     *       that don't use exceptions, they return an error).
     *
     *
     * - `Charge`:
     *
     *   The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. The
     *   request can also result in a data retrieval charge for the source if the source storage class bills for data
     *   retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the data transfer is billed to the copy source account. For
     *   pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing [^9].
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:
     *
     *   **Directory buckets ** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com`.

     * > This action creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see `CreateBucket` [^1].
     *
     * Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access
     * Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you
     * become the bucket owner.
     *
     * There are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about these
     * bucket types, see Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets [^2] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * > - **General purpose buckets** - If you send your `CreateBucket` request to the `s3.amazonaws.com` global endpoint,
     * >   the request goes to the `us-east-1` Region. So the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use
     * >   `us-east-1` as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the
     * >   bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application
     * >   must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets [^3] in the *Amazon S3
     * >   User Guide*.
     * > - **Directory buckets ** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional
     * >   endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format
     * >   `https://s3express-control.*region_code*.amazonaws.com/*bucket-name*`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't
     * >   supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints [^4] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     * >
     *
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - In addition to the `s3:CreateBucket` permission, the following
     *     permissions are required in a policy when your `CreateBucket` request includes specific headers:
     *
     *     - **Access control lists (ACLs)** - In your `CreateBucket` request, if you specify an access control list (ACL)
     *       and set it to `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read`, or if you explicitly specify any other
     *       custom ACLs, both `s3:CreateBucket` and `s3:PutBucketAcl` permissions are required. In your `CreateBucket`
     *       request, if you set the ACL to `private`, or if you don't specify any ACLs, only the `s3:CreateBucket`
     *       permission is required.
     *     - **Object Lock** - In your `CreateBucket` request, if you set `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled` to true, the
     *       `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration` and `s3:PutBucketVersioning` permissions are required.
     *     - **S3 Object Ownership** - If your `CreateBucket` request includes the `x-amz-object-ownership` header, then the
     *       `s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls` permission is required.
     *
     *       ! To set an ACL on a bucket as part of a `CreateBucket` request, you must explicitly set S3 Object Ownership
     *       ! for the bucket to a different value than the default, `BucketOwnerEnforced`. Additionally, if your desired
     *       ! bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then
     *       ! explicitly disable Block Public Access on the bucket before using `PutBucketAcl` to set the ACL. If you try
     *       ! to create a bucket with a public ACL, the request will fail.
     *       !
     *       ! For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep all Block Public Access settings
     *       ! enabled and keep ACLs disabled. If you would like to share data with users outside of your account, you can
     *       ! use bucket policies as needed. For more information, see Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs
     *       ! for your bucket [^5] and Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage [^6] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *     - **S3 Block Public Access** - If your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources,
     *       you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can create a new bucket with Block Public Access
     *       enabled, then separately call the `DeletePublicAccessBlock` [^7] API. To use this operation, you must have the
     *       `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see Blocking
     *       public access to your Amazon S3 storage [^8] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have the `s3express:CreateBucket` permission in an IAM identity-based
     *     policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can
     *     only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory
     *     bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One
     *     Zone [^9] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *     ! The permissions for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership, and S3 Block Public Access are not supported for
     *     ! directory buckets. For directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled at the bucket level and
     *     ! S3 Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified.
     *     !
     *     ! For more information about permissions for creating and working with directory buckets, see Directory buckets
     *     ! [^10] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about supported S3 features for directory buckets,

     * upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview [^2] in the *Amazon S3

     *
     * > After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded
     * > parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts
     * > and stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.
     *
     * If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the created multipart upload must be

     * >
     *
     * - `Request signing`:
     *
     *   For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send
     *   one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request
     *   individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing,
     *   see Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) [^5] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - For information about the permissions required to use the multipart
     *     upload API, see Multipart upload and permissions [^6] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *     To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have
     *     permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These permissions are required
     *     because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart
     *     upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions [^7] and Protecting data using server-side
     *     encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS [^8] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^9] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^10].
     *
     * - `Encryption`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose buckets** - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data
     *     as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts
     *     all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption
     *     information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption
     *     configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration
     *     that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default
     *     encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or
     *     a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key
     *     to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different
     *     type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a
     *     different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the
     *     encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination
     *     bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption
     *     key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart [^11] and UploadPartCopy [^12] requests must match the headers
     *     you used in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request.
     *
     *     - Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) and KMS customer managed
     *       keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to
     *       encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.
     *
     *       - `x-amz-server-side-encryption`
     *       - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`
     *       - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`
     *
     *       > - If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't provide
     *       >   `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`
     *       >   key) in KMS to protect the data.
     *       > - To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must
     *       >   have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These permissions are
     *       >   required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the
     *       >   multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions [^13] and Protecting data
     *       >   using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS [^14] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *       > - If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the
     *       >   KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role is in a different
     *       >   account from the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.
     *       > - All `GET` and `PUT` requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don't make them by using Secure
     *       >   Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4. For information about
     *       >   configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see

     *     - Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all
     *       the following headers in the request.
     *
     *       - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`

     * Removes an object from a bucket. The behavior depends on the bucket's versioning state:.
     *
     * - If bucket versioning is not enabled, the operation permanently deletes the object.
     * - If bucket versioning is enabled, the operation inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current version of the
     *   object. To permanently delete an object in a versioned bucket, you must include the object’s `versionId` in the
     *   request. For more information about versioning-enabled buckets, see Deleting object versions from a
     *   versioning-enabled bucket [^1].
     * - If bucket versioning is suspended, the operation removes the object that has a null `versionId`, if there is one,
     *   and inserts a delete marker that becomes the current version of the object. If there isn't an object with a null
     *   `versionId`, and all versions of the object have a `versionId`, Amazon S3 does not remove the object and only
     *   inserts a delete marker. To permanently delete an object that has a `versionId`, you must include the object’s
     *   `versionId` in the request. For more information about versioning-suspended buckets, see Deleting objects from
     *   versioning-suspended buckets [^2].
     *
     * > - **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation,
     * >   only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the
     * >   `versionId` query parameter in the request.
     * > - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal
     * >   endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
     * >   `https://*bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not

     * >
     *
     * To remove a specific version, you must use the `versionId` query parameter. Using this query parameter permanently
     * deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header
     * `x-amz-delete-marker` to true.
     *
     * If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you
     * must include the `x-amz-mfa` request header in the DELETE `versionId` request. Requests that include `x-amz-mfa` must
     * use HTTPS. For more information about MFA Delete, see Using MFA Delete [^4] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. To see

     *       permission.
     *     - **`s3:DeleteObjectVersion`** - To delete a specific version of an object from a versioning-enabled bucket, you
     *       must have the `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` permission.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^7] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create

    /**
     * Retrieves an object from Amazon S3.
     *
     * In the `GetObject` request, specify the full key name for the object.
     *
     * **General purpose buckets** - Both the virtual-hosted-style requests and the path-style requests are supported. For a
     * virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`, specify the object
     * key name as `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For a path-style request example, if you have the object
     * `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket named `examplebucket`, specify the object key name as
     * `/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header
     * Bucket Specification [^1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * **Directory buckets** - Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example,
     * if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket named `examplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3`, specify
     * the object key name as `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your
     * requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
     * `https://*bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported.
     * For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints [^2] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the required permissions in a policy. To use `GetObject`,
     *     you must have the `READ` access to the object (or version). If you grant `READ` access to the anonymous user, the
     *     `GetObject` operation returns the object without using an authorization header. For more information, see
     *     Specifying permissions in a policy [^3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *     If you include a `versionId` in your request header, you must have the `s3:GetObjectVersion` permission to access
     *     a specific version of an object. The `s3:GetObject` permission is not required in this scenario.
     *
     *     If you request the current version of an object without a specific `versionId` in the request header, only the
     *     `s3:GetObject` permission is required. The `s3:GetObjectVersion` permission is not required in this scenario.
     *
     *     If the object that you request doesn’t exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have
     *     the `s3:ListBucket` permission.
     *
     *     - If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found`
     *       error.
     *     - If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Access Denied`
     *       error.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^4] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^5].
     *
     * - `Storage classes`:
     *
     *   If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep
     *   Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive
     *   Access tier, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject [^6]. Otherwise,
     *   this operation returns an `InvalidObjectState` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see
     *   Restoring Archived Objects [^7] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *   **Directory buckets ** - For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is supported to store
     *   newly created objects. Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the
     *   HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.
     * - `Encryption`:
     *
     *   Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for the `GetObject` requests,
     *   if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption
     *   with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS
     *   keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your `GetObject` requests for the object that uses these types of
     *   keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error.
     * - `Overriding response header values through the request`:
     *
     *   There are times when you want to override certain response header values of a `GetObject` response. For example,
     *   you might override the `Content-Disposition` response header value through your `GetObject` request.
     *
     *   You can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response header values are included only in a
     *   successful response, that is, when the HTTP status code `200 OK` is returned. The headers you can override using
     *   the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an
     *   object.
     *
     *   The response headers that you can override for the `GetObject` response are `Cache-Control`, `Content-Disposition`,
     *   `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, and `Expires`.
     *
     *   To override values for a set of response headers in the `GetObject` response, you can use the following query
     *   parameters in the request.
     *
     *   - `response-cache-control`
     *   - `response-content-disposition`
     *   - `response-content-encoding`
     *   - `response-content-language`
     *   - `response-content-type`
     *   - `response-expires`
     *
     *   > When you use these parameters, you must sign the request by using either an Authorization header or a presigned
     *   > URL. These parameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.
     *
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:
     *
     *   **Directory buckets ** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com`.
     *
     * The following operations are related to `GetObject`:

     *     - If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Forbidden`
     *       error.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^4] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^5].
     *
     * - `Encryption`:
     *
     *   > Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD` requests if your
     *   > object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side
     *   > encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
     *   > encryption keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object to S3 and
     *   > want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a `HEAD` request for an object that uses
     *   > these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be
     *   > changed when you retrieve the object.
     *
     *   If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you
     *   store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following
     *   headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:
     *
     *   - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
     *   - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
     *   - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`
     *
     *   For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) [^6] in the
     *   *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *   > **Directory bucket permissions** - For directory buckets, only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
     *   > (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) is supported.
     *
     * - `Versioning`:
     *
     *   - If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and
     *     includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.
     *   - If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error and the
     *     `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.
     *
     *   > - **Directory buckets** - Delete marker is not supported by directory buckets.
     *   > - **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API
     *   >   operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify
     *   >   `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.
     *   >
     *

     *     two criteria:
     *
     *     - Key-based sorting - Multipart uploads are initially sorted in ascending order based on their object keys.
     *     - Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the same object key, they are further sorted in ascending order
     *       based on the upload initiation time. Among uploads with the same key, the one that was initiated first will
     *       appear before the ones that were initiated later.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket** - In the `ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted
     *     lexicographically based on the object keys.
     *
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:
     *

     * > **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.
     * > These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
     * > `https://*bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported.
     * > For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints [^3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload
     *     API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions [^4] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *     If the upload was created using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or
     *     dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), you must have permission to the
     *     `kms:Decrypt` action for the `ListParts` request to succeed.
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^5] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^6].
     *
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:

     * Sets the `cors` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.
     *
     * To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the `s3:PutBucketCORS` action. By default, the bucket owner has
     * this permission and can grant it to others.
     *
     * You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might

     * `my.example.bucket.com` by using the browser's `XMLHttpRequest` capability.
     *
     * To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the `cors` subresource to the bucket. The `cors`
     * subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be
     * executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.
     *
     * When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the
     * `cors` configuration on the bucket and uses the first `CORSRule` rule that matches the incoming browser request to
     * enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:
     *
     * - The request's `Origin` header must match `AllowedOrigin` elements.
     * - The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in case
     *   of a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request must be one of the `AllowedMethod` elements.
     * - Every header specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header of a pre-flight request must match an
     *   `AllowedHeader` element.

     *
     * Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines
     * the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event
     * notification when it detects an event of the specified type.

     *
     * By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket
     * policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with the required `s3:PutBucketNotification`
     * permission.
     *
     * > The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS
     * > topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon

     * > - If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer
     * >   affect permissions. All objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.
     * > - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal

     * >
     *
     * Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it
     * overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides features that can modify this behavior:
     *
     * - **S3 Object Lock** - To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use Amazon S3 Object Lock [^2]
     *   in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     *   > This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
     *
     * - **S3 Versioning** - When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the
     *   same object simultaneously, it stores all versions of the objects. For each write request that is made to the same
     *   object, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that object being stored in Amazon S3. You can
     *   retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the object. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects
     *   to Versioning-Enabled Buckets [^3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about returning the versioning
     *   state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning [^4].
     *
     *   > This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
     *
     *
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - The following permissions are required in your policies when your
     *     `PutObject` request includes specific headers.
     *
     *     - **`s3:PutObject`** - To successfully complete the `PutObject` request, you must always have the `s3:PutObject`
     *       permission on a bucket to add an object to it.
     *     - **`s3:PutObjectAcl`** - To successfully change the objects ACL of your `PutObject` request, you must have the
     *       `s3:PutObjectAcl`.
     *     - **`s3:PutObjectTagging`** - To successfully set the tag-set with your `PutObject` request, you must have the
     *       `s3:PutObjectTagging`.
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^5] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^6].
     *
     * - `Data integrity with Content-MD5`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket** - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the `Content-MD5`
     *     header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not
     *     match, Amazon S3 returns an error. Alternatively, when the object's ETag is its MD5 digest, you can calculate the
     *     MD5 while putting the object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.
     *   - **Directory bucket** - This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
     *
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:
     *
     *   **Directory buckets ** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com`.

    /**
     * > This operation is not supported by directory buckets.
     *
     * Uses the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3
     * bucket. You must have the `WRITE_ACP` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What
     * permissions can I grant? [^1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
     *
     * Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the
     * headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can
     * continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview [^2] in the *Amazon S3
     * User Guide*.
     *
     * ! If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer
     * ! affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set
     * ! ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still
     * ! supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership [^3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
     *
     *   - Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as
     *     canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the
     *     value of `x-amz-ac`l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
     *     request. For more information, see Canned ACL [^4].
     *   - Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,
     *     `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit
     *     access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the
     *     permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use `x-amz-acl` header to set a canned ACL. These
     *     parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access
     *     Control List (ACL) Overview [^5].
     *
     *     You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:
     *
     *     - `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account
     *     - `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
     *     - `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account
     *
     *       > Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
     *       >
     *       > - US East (N. Virginia)
     *       > - US West (N. California)
     *       > - US West (Oregon)
     *       > - Asia Pacific (Singapore)
     *       > - Asia Pacific (Sydney)
     *       > - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
     *       > - Europe (Ireland)
     *       > - South America (São Paulo)
     *       >
     *       > For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints [^6] in the Amazon
     *       > Web Services General Reference.
     *
     *
     *     For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web
     *     Services accounts identified by their email addresses.
     *
     *     `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" `
     *
     *   You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.
     * - `Grantee Values`:
     *
     *   You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the
     *   following ways:
     *
     *   - By the person's ID:
     *
     *     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     *     xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
     *     </Grantee>`
     *
     *     DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.
     *   - By URI:
     *
     *     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     *     xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`
     *   - By Email address:
     *
     *     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     *     xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`
     *
     *     The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the
     *     CanonicalUser.
     *
     *     > Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
     *     >
     *     > - US East (N. Virginia)
     *     > - US West (N. California)
     *     > - US West (Oregon)
     *     > - Asia Pacific (Singapore)
     *     > - Asia Pacific (Sydney)
     *     > - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
     *     > - Europe (Ireland)

     *     > Web Services General Reference.
     *
     *
     * - `Versioning`:
     *
     *   The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an
     *   object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the `versionId` subresource.
     *
     * The following operations are related to `PutObjectAcl`:

     * Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
     *
     * > In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have an option to
     * > specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an
     * > existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy [^1] operation.
     *
     * You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload [^2]) before you can upload any part. In response to
     * your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part
     * request.
     *
     * Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines
     * its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with
     * a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.
     *
     * For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload
     * limits [^3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * > After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart

     *
     * For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview [^4] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide *.
     *
     * > **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.
     * > These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
     * > `https://*bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported.
     * > For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints [^5] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload
     *     API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions [^6] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that
     *     you use the `CreateSession` [^7] API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
     *     `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.
     *     Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in
     *     your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make
     *     another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
     *     session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For
     *     more information about authorization, see `CreateSession` [^8].
     *
     * - `Data integrity`:
     *
     *   **General purpose bucket** - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the `Content-MD5`
     *   header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not
     *   match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web
     *   Services S3 uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For more information see
     *   Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) [^9].
     *
     *   > **Directory buckets** - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check
     *   > object integrity.
     *
     * - `Encryption`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket** - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data
     *     as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive
     *     options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the
     *     encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web
     *     Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side
     *     encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at
     *     rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use
     *     KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C).
     *
     *     Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are using a
     *     customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart
     *     request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate
     *     Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload [^10].
     *
     *     If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart
     *     upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following request
     *     headers.
     *
     *     - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
     *     - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
     *     - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
     *
     *   - **Directory bucket** - For directory buckets, only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
     *     (`AES256`) is supported.
     *
     *   For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption [^11] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     * - `Special errors`:
     *
     *   - Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`
     *
     *     - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart
     *       upload might have been aborted or completed.
     *     - HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found
     *     - SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client
     *
     *
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:

    /**
     * Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. To specify the data source, you add the
     * request header `x-amz-copy-source` in your request. To specify a byte range, you add the request header
     * `x-amz-copy-source-range` in your request.
     *
     * For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload
     * limits [^1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * > Instead of copying data from an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart [^2] action to upload
     * > new data as a part of an object in your request.
     *
     * You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3
     * returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.
     *
     * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload [^3] in the *Amazon
     * S3 User Guide*. For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see
     * Operations on Objects [^4] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * > **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.
     * > These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
     * > `https://*bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com/*key-name*`. Path-style requests are not supported.
     * > For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints [^5] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Authentication and authorization`:
     *
     *   All `UploadPartCopy` requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret
     *   access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be
     *   signed. For more information, see REST Authentication [^6].
     *
     *   **Directory buckets** - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the
     *   `UploadPartCopy` API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API
     *   operation.
     *
     *   Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.
     * - `Permissions`:
     *
     *   You must have `READ` access to the source object and `WRITE` access to the destination bucket.
     *
     *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of
     *     your source bucket and destination bucket in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.
     *
     *     - If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:GetObject`** permission to read
     *       the source object that is being copied.
     *     - If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:PutObject`** permission to write
     *       the object copy to the destination bucket.
     *
     *     For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions
     *     [^7] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy
     *     based on the source and destination bucket types in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.
     *
     *     - If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the
     *       **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy to read the object . By default,
     *       the session is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the
     *       `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the copy source bucket.
     *     - If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in
     *       the `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The `s3express:SessionMode` condition
     *       key cannot be set to `ReadOnly` on the copy destination.
     *
     *     For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone [^8] and Amazon Web Services Identity
     *     and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone [^9] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
     *
     * - `Encryption`:
     *
     *   - **General purpose buckets ** - For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided
     *     encryption keys with the `UploadPartCopy` operation, see CopyObject [^10] and UploadPart [^11].
     *   - **Directory buckets ** - For directory buckets, only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
     *     (`AES256`) is supported.
     *
     * - `Special errors`:
     *
     *   - Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`
     *
     *     - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart
     *       upload might have been aborted or completed.
     *     - HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found
     *
     *   - Error Code: `InvalidRequest`
     *
     *     - Description: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source.
     *     - HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request
     *
     *
     * - `HTTP Host header syntax`:
     *
     *   **Directory buckets ** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `*Bucket_name*.s3express-*az_id*.*region*.amazonaws.com`.
     *
     * The following operations are related to `UploadPartCopy`:
     *
     * - CreateMultipartUpload [^12]
