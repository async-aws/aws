 * Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes outputs. Only enable Timecode insertion when the input frame rate is
 * identical to the output frame rate. To include timecodes in this output, set Timecode insertion to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To
 * leave them out, set it to DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When the service inserts timecodes in an output, by default,
 * it uses any embedded timecodes from the input. If none are present, the service will set the timecode for the first
 * output frame to zero. To change this default behavior, adjust the settings under Timecode configuration. In the
 * console, these settings are located under Job > Job settings > Timecode configuration. Note - Timecode source under
 * input settings does not affect the timecodes that are inserted in the output. Source under Job settings > Timecode
 * configuration does.
