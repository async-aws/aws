namespace AsyncAws\MediaConvert\Enum;

/**
 * Specify how MediaConvert selects audio content within your input. The default is Track. PID: Select audio by
 * specifying the Packet Identifier (PID) values for MPEG Transport Stream inputs. Use this when you know the exact PID
 * values of your audio streams. Track: Default. Select audio by track number. This is the most common option and works
 * with most input container formats. If more types of audio data get recognized in the future, these numberings may
 * shift, but the numberings used for Stream mode will not. Language code: Select audio by language using an ISO 639-2
 * or ISO 639-3 three-letter    code in all capital letters. Use this when your source has embedded language metadata
 * and you want to select tracks based on their language. HLS rendition group: Select audio from an HLS rendition group.
 * Use this when your input is an HLS package with multiple audio renditions and you want to select specific rendition
 * groups. All PCM: Select all uncompressed PCM audio tracks from your input automatically. This is useful when you want
 * to include all PCM audio tracks without specifying individual track numbers. Stream: Select audio by stream number.
 * Stream numbers include all tracks in the source file, regardless of type, and correspond to either the order of
 * tracks in the file, or if applicable, the stream number metadata of the track. Although all tracks count toward these
 * stream numbers, in this audio selector context, only the stream number of a track containing audio data may be used.
 * If your source file contains a track which is not recognized by the service, then the corresponding stream number
 * will still be reserved for future use. If more types of audio data get recognized in the future, these numberings
 * will not shift.
