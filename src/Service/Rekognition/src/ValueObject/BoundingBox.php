/**
 * Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text, object of interest, or personal protective equipment. The
 * `left` (x-coordinate) and `top` (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the bounding
 * box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).
 *
 * The `top` and `left` values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the input image is 700x200
 * pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a `left` value of 0.5
 * (350/700) and a `top` value of 0.25 (50/200).
 *
 * The `width` and `height` values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image
 * dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width
 * returned is 0.1.
 *
 * > The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face
 * > that is at the image edge and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that are outside the
 * > image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you might get negative values or values greater than 1 for the
 * > `left` or `top` values.
