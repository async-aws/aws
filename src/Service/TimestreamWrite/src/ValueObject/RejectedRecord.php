     * The reason why a record was not successfully inserted into Timestream. Possible causes of failure include:
     *
     * - Records with duplicate data where there are multiple records with the same dimensions, timestamps, and measure
     *   names but:
     *
     *   - Measure values are different
     *   - Version is not present in the request, *or* the value of version in the new record is equal to or lower than the
     *     existing value
     *
     *   If Timestream rejects data for this case, the `ExistingVersion` field in the `RejectedRecords` response will
     *   indicate the current recordâ€™s version. To force an update, you can resend the request with a version for the
     *   record set to a value greater than the `ExistingVersion`.
     * - Records with timestamps that lie outside the retention duration of the memory store.
     *
     *   > When the retention window is updated, you will receive a `RejectedRecords` exception if you immediately try to
     *   > ingest data within the new window. To avoid a `RejectedRecords` exception, wait until the duration of the new
     *   > window to ingest new data. For further information, see Best Practices for Configuring Timestream [^1] and the
     *   > explanation of how storage works in Timestream [^2].
     *
     * - Records with dimensions or measures that exceed the Timestream defined limits.
