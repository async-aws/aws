/**
 * The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the setting Adaptive
 * quantization (adaptiveQuantization). When you do so, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of
 * quantization for your video content. Include this setting in your JSON job specification only when you choose to
 * change the default value for Adaptive quantization. For this setting, keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to
 * adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature,
 * the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses
 * more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded
 * with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always
 * improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is
 * likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex
 * texture, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization,
 * set the value for Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content,
 * such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or
 * Higher.
