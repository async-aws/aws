     * Secrets Manager `rate()` expressions represent the interval in hours or days that you want to rotate your secret, for
     * example `rate(12 hours)` or `rate(10 days)`. You can rotate a secret as often as every four hours. If you use a
     * `rate()` expression, the rotation window starts at midnight. For a rate in hours, the default rotation window closes
     * after one hour. For a rate in days, the default rotation window closes at the end of the day. You can set the
     * `Duration` to change the rotation window. The rotation window must not extend into the next UTC day or into the next
     * rotation window.
     *
     * You can use a `cron()` expression to create a rotation schedule that is more detailed than a rotation interval. For
     * more information, including examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation [^1] in the *Secrets
     * Manager Users Guide*. For a cron expression that represents a schedule in hours, the default rotation window closes
     * after one hour. For a cron expression that represents a schedule in days, the default rotation window closes at the
