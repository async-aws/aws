The client supports presign of requests to be able to pass the URL to a normal mortal
person so they can download a file within the next X minutes. Read more about presign
[here](/features/presign.md).

> **Note**: There is a [SimpleS3Client](/integration/simple-s3.md) that might be easier to work with for common use cases.

## Usage

### Upload files

If you want to upload a 1 Gb file, you really don't want to put that file in memory
before uploading. You want to do it a smarter way. AsyncAws allow you to upload
files using a string, resource, closure or a iterable. See the following examples:

```php
use AsyncAws\S3\S3Client;

$s3 = new S3Client();

// Upload plain text
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'robots.txt',
    'Body' => "User-agent: *\nDisallow:",
]);

// Upload with stream
$resource = \fopen('/path/to/big/file', 'r');
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'file.jpg',
    'Body' => $resource,
]);

// Upload with Closure
$fp = \fopen('/path/to/big/file', 'r');
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'file.jpg',
    'ContentLength' => filesize('/path/to/big/file'), // This is important
    'Body' => static function(int $length) use ($fp): string {
        return fread($fp, $length);
    },
]);

// Upload with an iterable
$files = ['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt'];
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'file_merged.jpg',
    'ContentLength' => array_sum(array_map('filesize', $files)), // This is important
    'Body' => (static function() use($files): iterable {
        foreach ($files as $file) {
            yield file_get_contents($file);
        }
    })(),
]);
```

When using a `Closure`, it's important to provide the property `ContentLength`.
This information is required by AWS, and cannot be guessed by AsyncAws.
If `ContentLength` is absent, AsyncAws will read the output before sending the
request which could have a performance impact.


### Download files

When you download a file from S3, AsyncAws gives you a `ResultStream` which
can be used as a string, as a resource, or iterated over. This allows you to handle
larger files without having them in memory.

```
// download a file and use it directly as string
$result = $s3->GetObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'metadata.json',
]);
$metadata = json_decode($result->getBody()->getContentAsString());

// download a big file and save it efficiently
$result = $s3->GetObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'bunny.mkv',
]);
$fp = fopen('/path/to/big_file.mkv', 'wb');
stream_copy_to_stream($f->getBody()->getContentAsResource(), $fp);

// use an iterable to perform some business logic on chunks while downloading (or show a progress bar)
$result = $s3->GetObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'orders.csv',
]);
$fp = fopen('/path/to/orders.csv', 'wb');
foreach ($result->getBody()->getChunks() as $chunk) {
    fwrite($fp, $chunk);
    $progress->advance();
}
```

## Virtual Hosted-Style Requests

When calling AWS endpoints, AsyncAws uses [Virtual Hosted-Style Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html):
The bucket name is part of the endpoint's host. To change this behavior, and use
"path styled endpoints" instead, set `pathStyleEndpoint` parameter to `true` when
initializing the client.

```php
use AsyncAws\S3\S3Client;

$s3 = new S3Client(['pathStyleEndpoint' => true]);
```

## Chunked body

When sending data to AWS endpoints, AsyncAws split the content in multiple
chunks. This improves UX by avoiding reading the file twice (required
[to compute the signature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html)
) which could be a performance issue when file is really big, or the uploaded
content is not a file (ie. streamed from an HTTP request). But some 3rd party
services like Openstack Swift, pretending being "S3-compatible" does not
support chunked body. To change this behavior, set `sendChunkedBody` parameter
to `false` when initializing the client.

```php
use AsyncAws\S3\S3Client;

$s3 = new S3Client(['sendChunkedBody' => false]);
```

## Non-AWS S3 endpoints

To use the `S3Client` with example Digital Oceans' Spaces, you need to initialize
the `S3Client` with your endpoint.

```php
$s3 = new S3Client([
    'endpoint' => 'https://fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com',
    'pathStyleEndpoint' => true,
]);
```
