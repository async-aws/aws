# Contribution guide

Contribution are always appreciated. Like most contribution guides there are links
to [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
and [information about Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
There are also some extra info you need to know about the async-aws/aws repository
that might differ from other repositories.

1. It is a mono repository
1. Most code is generated

Read about them [below](#this-repo-is-special).

There are many ways to contribute to a project then just writing code. All of them
are equally important. Some super helpful things include (in no particular order):

- Write issues
- Comment on issues
- Verify bugs submitted by other people
- Review PRs
- Test PRs
- Write documentation
- Make the website more pretty and accessible
- Tweet or blog about AsyncAws

Read more about documentation and the website [here](./website.md).

## This repo is special

### Mono repository

It means that all PRs and issues goes to [async-aws/aws](https://github.com/async-aws/aws)
and not to individual client's repositories. When a commit is merged to master, the
[Subtree Split](https://www.subtreesplit.com/) service will push the changes to other
repositories.

Using a mono repository will simplify maintenance.

### Generated code

Most classes and functions in this repository are generated by [the code generator](https://github.com/async-aws/aws/tree/master/src/CodeGenerator).
API clients, input classes, result classes etc are generated from the JSON provided
by the official [AWS PHP SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php). This will assure
correctness and it will be easy to keep up to with API changes.

As a rule of thumb all code in `src/Service` is generated. That code cannot be manually
changed. Only the test code can be manually changed.

To create a class run the `generate` command.

```shell
./generate

# Or
./generate S3 CreateBucket
```

The `./manifest.json` file contains information where the source is located
and some metadata about the generated files and methods.

You may also regenerate an existing operation and result classes:

```shell
./generate S3 CreateBucket
./generate S3 --all
```

Or regenerate everything:

```shell
./generate --all
```

Read more about generating new code [here](./generate.md).
