# S3 Client

Everyone's favorite client. It supports most common use cases like uploading and
downloading files and setting permissions etc.

You can of course presign requests to be able to pass the URL to a normal mortal
person so they can download a file within the next X minutes. Read more about presign
[here](/features/presign.md).

## Examples

### Upload file

If you want to upload a 1 Gb file, you really dont want to put that file in memory
before uploading. You want to use a something smarted. AsyncAws allow you to upload
files using a string, resource, closure or a iterable. See the following examples:

```php
use AsyncAws\S3\S3Client;

$s3 = new S3Client();

// Upload plain text
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'foo',
    'Key' => 'file.txt',
    'Body' => 'foobar',
]);

// Upload with stream
$resource = \fopen('/path/to/big/file', 'r');
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'foo',
    'Key' => 'file.jpg',
    'Body' => $resource,
]);

// Upload with Closure
$fp = \fopen('/path/to/big/file', 'r');
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'foo',
    'Key' => 'file.jpg',
    'ContentLength' => filesize('/path/to/big/file'), // This is important
    'Body' => static function(int $length) use ($fp): string {
        return fread($fp, $length);
    },
]);

// Upload with an iterable
$files = ['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt'];
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'foo',
    'Key' => 'file_merged.jpg',
    'ContentLength' => array_sum(array_map('filesize', $files)), // This is important
    'Body' => (static function() use($files): iterable {
        foreach ($files as $file) {
            yield file_get_contents($file);
        }
    })(),
]);
```

When using a `Closure`, it's important to provide the property `ContentLength`.
This information is required by AWS, and cannot be guessed by AsyncAws.
If `ContentLength` is absent, AsyncAws will read the output before sending the
request which could have a performance impact.
