The client supports presign of requests to be able to pass the URL to a normal mortal
person so they can download a file within the next X minutes. Read more about presign
[here](/features/presign.md).

## Usage

### Upload file

If you want to upload a 1 Gb file, you really dont want to put that file in memory
before uploading. You want to use a something smarted. AsyncAws allow you to upload
files using a string, resource, closure or a iterable. See the following examples:

```php
use AsyncAws\S3\S3Client;

$s3 = new S3Client();

// Upload plain text
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'robots.txt',
    'Body' => "User-agent: *\nDisallow:",
]);

// Upload with stream
$resource = \fopen('/path/to/big/file', 'r');
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'file.jpg',
    'Body' => $resource,
]);

// Upload with Closure
$fp = \fopen('/path/to/big/file', 'r');
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'file.jpg',
    'ContentLength' => filesize('/path/to/big/file'), // This is important
    'Body' => static function(int $length) use ($fp): string {
        return fread($fp, $length);
    },
]);

// Upload with an iterable
$files = ['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt'];
$s3->PutObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-company-website',
    'Key' => 'file_merged.jpg',
    'ContentLength' => array_sum(array_map('filesize', $files)), // This is important
    'Body' => (static function() use($files): iterable {
        foreach ($files as $file) {
            yield file_get_contents($file);
        }
    })(),
]);
```

When using a `Closure`, it's important to provide the property `ContentLength`.
This information is required by AWS, and cannot be guessed by AsyncAws.
If `ContentLength` is absent, AsyncAws will read the output before sending the
request which could have a performance impact.
