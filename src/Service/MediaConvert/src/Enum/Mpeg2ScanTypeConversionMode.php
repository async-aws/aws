/**
 * Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this
 * situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive
 * frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing, for
 * all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then
 * interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't
 * suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To
 * use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine to None or Soft. You can't use optimized interlacing for hard
 * telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.
