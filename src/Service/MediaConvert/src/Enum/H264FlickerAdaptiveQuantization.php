/**
 * Only use this setting when you change the default value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you
 * keep all defaults, excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization from your JSON job
 * specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. When you set
 * H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization is
 * Disabled (DISABLED). Change this value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce I-frame pop. I-frame pop appears as a visual
 * flicker that can arise when the encoder saves bits by copying some macroblocks many times from frame to frame, and
 * then refreshes them at the I-frame. When you enable this setting, the encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more
 * often to smooth out the flicker. To manually enable or disable H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive
 * quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value other than AUTO.
