    /**
     * You can use the `GetMetricData` API to retrieve CloudWatch metric values. The operation can also include a CloudWatch
     * Metrics Insights query, and one or more metric math functions.
     *
     * A `GetMetricData` operation that does not include a query can retrieve as many as 500 different metrics in a single
     * request, with a total of as many as 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform metric math expressions on
     * the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For
     * example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time
     * series. For more information about metric math expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions [^1] in the *Amazon
     * CloudWatch User Guide*.
     *
     * If you include a Metrics Insights query, each `GetMetricData` operation can include only one query. But the same
     * `GetMetricData` operation can also retrieve other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent
     * three hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see Query your metrics with CloudWatch
     * Metrics Insights [^2].
     *
     * Calls to the `GetMetricData` API have a different pricing structure than calls to `GetMetricStatistics`. For more
     * information about pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing [^3].
     *
     * Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
     *
     * - Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution
     *   metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a `StorageResolution` of 1.
     * - Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.
     * - Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.
     * - Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).
     *
     * Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For
     * example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute
     * resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of
     * 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.
     *
     * If you omit `Unit` in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the
     * corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the
     * operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match
     * the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.
     *
     * **Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math**
     *
     * You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same expression, but you can reference results
     * from a Metrics Insights query within other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a **GROUP BY**
     * clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects a single
     * time series. A Metrics Insights query with a **GROUP BY** clause returns an array of time-series (TS[]), and can be
     * used as input for a metric math expression that expects an array of time series.

     * The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points,
     * CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make
     * multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned
     * in chronological order.
     *
     * CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request
     * statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each
     * one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points
     * returned.
     *
     * CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set
     * instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:
     *
     * - The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.
     * - The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.
     *
     * Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

     *
     * You can publish either individual data points in the `Value` field, or arrays of values and the number of times each

     * supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.
     *
     * Each `PutMetricData` request is limited to 1 MB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by
     * gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 1000 different metrics.

     * Although the `Value` parameter accepts numbers of type `Double`, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small
     * or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN,
     * +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.
