 * Specify whether MediaConvert generates HLS manifests while your job is running or when your job is complete. To

 * written to your destination S3 bucket. It then writes new updated manifests after each additional segment is written.
 * The parent manifest includes the latest BANDWIDTH and AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH attributes, and child manifests include the
 * latest available media segment. When your job completes, the final child playlists include an EXT-X-ENDLIST tag. To
 * generate HLS manifests only when your job completes: Choose Disabled.
