/**
 * This structure is used in both `GetMetricData` and `PutMetricAlarm`. The supported use of this structure is different
 * for those two operations.
 * When used in `GetMetricData`, it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a
 * batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single `GetMetricData` call
 * can include up to 500 `MetricDataQuery` structures.
 * When used in `PutMetricAlarm`, it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each
 * `MetricDataQuery` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on
 * retrieved metrics. A single `PutMetricAlarm` call can include up to 20 `MetricDataQuery` structures in the array. The
 * 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a `MetricStat` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as
 * many as 10 structures that contain the `Expression` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those `Expression`
 * structures, one must have `True` as the value for `ReturnData`. The result of this expression is the value the alarm
 * watches.
 * Any expression used in a `PutMetricAlarm` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see
 * Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.
 * Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a
 * `GetMetricData` operation or a `PutMetricAlarm` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter
 * list.
