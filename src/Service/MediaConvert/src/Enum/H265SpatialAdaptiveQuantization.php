/**
 * Keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content
 * complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with
 * no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For
 * example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits.
 * Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take
 * into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a
 * part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you
 * enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization depending on your content. For
 * homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures,
 * set it to High or Higher.
