 * When you do frame rate conversion from 23.976 frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your output scan type is
 * interlaced, you can optionally enable hard or soft telecine to create a smoother picture. Hard telecine produces a
 * 29.97i output. Soft telecine produces an output with a 23.976 output that signals to the video player device to do
 * the conversion during play back. When you keep the default value, None, MediaConvert does a standard frame rate
 * conversion to 29.97 without doing anything with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.
