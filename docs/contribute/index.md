# Contribute

We always appreciate contributions. Like most contribution guides there are showing
links to [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
and [information about Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
If you feel you know that already, there are some extra info you need to know about
this async-aws/aws repository that might differ from other repositories.

1. It is a mono repository
1. Most code is generated

Read about them [below](#this-repo-is-special).

There are more ways to contribute then just writing code. Other super helpful things
include (in no particular order:

- Write issues
- Comment on issues
- Verify bugs on other people's issues
- Review PRs
- Test PRs
- Write documentation
- Make the website more pretty and accessible

Read more about documentation and the website [here](./here.md).

## This repo is special

### Mono repository

It means that all PRs and issues goes to [async-aws/aws](https://github.com/async-aws/aws)
and not to individual client's repositories. On a merge to master we use [Subtree Split](https://www.subtreesplit.com/)
to push the changes to other repositories.

We do this to simplify maintenance.

### Generated code

Most classes and functions in this repository are generated by the code generator.
API clients, input classes, result classes etc are generated from the JSON provided
by the official [AWS PHP SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php). This will assure
correctness and it will be easy to keep up to with API changes.

As a rule of thumb all code in `src/Service` is generated. That code cannot be manually
changed. Only the test code can be manually changed.

To create a class run the `generate` command.

```shell
$ ./generate

# Or
$ ./generate S3 CreateBucket
```

The `./manifest.json` file contains information where the source is located
and some metadata about the generated files and methods.

You may also regenerate an existing operation and result classes:

```shell
$ ./generate S3 CreateBucket
$ ./generate S3 --all
```

Or regenerate everything:

```shell
$ ./generate --all
```

Read more about generating new code [here](./generate.md).
