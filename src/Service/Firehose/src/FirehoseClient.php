    /**
     * Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. To write multiple data records into
     * a delivery stream, use PutRecordBatch. Applications using these operations are referred to as producers.
     *
     * By default, each delivery stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per second, 5,000 records per second, or 5 MB
     * per second. If you use PutRecord and PutRecordBatch, the limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each
     * delivery stream. For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
     * Limits [^1].
     *
     * Kinesis Data Firehose accumulates and publishes a particular metric for a customer account in one minute intervals.
     * It is possible that the bursts of incoming bytes/records ingested to a delivery stream last only for a few seconds.
     * Due to this, the actual spikes in the traffic might not be fully visible in the customer's 1 minute CloudWatch
     * metrics.
     *
     * You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using PutRecord. The data record consists
     * of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KiB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it can be a segment from a log
     * file, geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on.
     *
     * Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at
     * the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (`\n`) or some other character
     * unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data
     * from the destination.
     *
     * The `PutRecord` operation returns a `RecordId`, which is a unique string assigned to each record. Producer
     * applications can use this ID for purposes such as auditability and investigation.
     *
     * If the `PutRecord` operation throws a `ServiceUnavailableException`, the API is automatically reinvoked (retried) 3
     * times. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery
     * stream.
     *
     * Re-invoking the Put API operations (for example, PutRecord and PutRecordBatch) can result in data duplicates. For
     * larger data assets, allow for a longer time out before retrying Put API operations.
     *
     * Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they are added to a delivery stream
     * as it tries to send the records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the
     * data is no longer available.
     *
     * ! Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your records. Instead, concatenate the raw
     * ! data, then perform base64 encoding.

     * For information about service quota, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota [^1].
     *
     * Each PutRecordBatch request supports up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB
     * (before base64 encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed.

     * unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data
     * from the destination.
     *
     * The PutRecordBatch response includes a count of failed records, `FailedPutCount`, and an array of responses,
     * `RequestResponses`. Even if the PutRecordBatch call succeeds, the value of `FailedPutCount` may be greater than 0,
     * indicating that there are records for which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the `RequestResponses` array
     * provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array
     * using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The response array always includes the same number of records as
     * the request array. `RequestResponses` includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data
     * Firehose tries to process all records in each PutRecordBatch request. A single record failure does not stop the
     * processing of subsequent records.
     *
     * A successfully processed record includes a `RecordId` value, which is unique for the record. An unsuccessfully
     * processed record includes `ErrorCode` and `ErrorMessage` values. `ErrorCode` reflects the type of error, and is one
     * of the following values: `ServiceUnavailableException` or `InternalFailure`. `ErrorMessage` provides more detailed
     * information about the error.
     *
     * If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have completed or it might have failed. If
     * `FailedPutCount` is greater than 0, retry the request, resending only those records that might have failed
     * processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding
     * charges). We recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.
     *
     * If PutRecordBatch throws `ServiceUnavailableException`, the API is automatically reinvoked (retried) 3 times. If the
     * exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream.
