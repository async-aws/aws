/**
 * The cause of this error depends on the operation that you're performing:.
 *
 * - **Create a public hosted zone:** Two hosted zones that have the same name or that have a parent/child relationship
 *   (example.com and test.example.com) can't have any common name servers. You tried to create a hosted zone that has
 *   the same name as an existing hosted zone or that's the parent or child of an existing hosted zone, and you
 *   specified a delegation set that shares one or more name servers with the existing hosted zone. For more
 *   information, see CreateReusableDelegationSet.
 * - **Create a private hosted zone:** A hosted zone with the specified name already exists and is already associated
 *   with the Amazon VPC that you specified.
 * - **Associate VPCs with a private hosted zone:** The VPC that you specified is already associated with another hosted
 *   zone that has the same name.
