 * interlaced with the same field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top or Follow, default bottom to produce
 * outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity
 * might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If the source is
 * interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source. If the source is progressive, the
 * output will be interlaced with top field bottom field first, depending on which of the Follow options you choose.
