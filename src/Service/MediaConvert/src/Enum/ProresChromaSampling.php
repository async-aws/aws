 * must specify a value for this setting when your output codec profile supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Related
 * Settings: For Apple ProRes outputs with 4:4:4 chroma sampling: Choose Preserve 4:4:4 sampling. Use when your input

 * Preserve 4:4:4 sampling, you cannot include any of the following Preprocessors: Dolby Vision, HDR10+, or Noise
 * reducer.
