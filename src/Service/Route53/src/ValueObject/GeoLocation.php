/**
 * *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS
 * queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to
 * a web server with an IP address of `192.0.2.111`, create a resource record set with a `Type` of `A` and a
 * `ContinentCode` of `AF`.
 *
 * > Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's
 * > not supported.
 *
 * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set
 * for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This
 * allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent
 * to a different resource.
 * You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.
 * The value `*` in the `CountryCode` element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other
 * geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements.
 *
 * ! Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic
 * ! locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will
 * ! receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set
 * ! for which the value of `CountryCode` is `*`. Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in
 * ! this record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and
 * ! queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a `*` resource record set, Route 53
 * ! returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.
 *
 * You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as
 * geolocation resource record sets.
