 * mixing. When you choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD, the encoder ignores any values you provide in AudioType and
 * FollowInputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the input does not contain pre-mixed audio + audio description (AD). In this
 * case, the encoder will use any values you provide for AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.
